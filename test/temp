Your `SceneTestFixture` covers the basic “happy‐path” and a few edge cases, but there are a handful of additional checks and refinements I’d recommend before calling this “production‐worthy.” Below is a point-by-point review of each test you have, followed by gaps you might want to fill and small improvements in style or clarity.

---

## 1. Intersect\_Single\_Triangle\_Hit

```cpp
TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_Single_Triangle_Hit)
{
  Scene scene;
  scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);

  EXPECT_EQ(scene.size(), 1);

  Ray ray(Vec3(0.25, 0.25, 1.0), Vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 100.0);

  HitRecord hit_record;
  ASSERT_TRUE(scene.intersect(ray, hit_record));
  EXPECT_NEAR(hit_record.t, 1.0, 1e-6);  // Expected t where hit occurs
  EXPECT_VEC3_EQ(ray.at(hit_record.t), Vec3(0.25, 0.25, 0.0));
}
```

### What it tests well

* Adds exactly one triangle to the scene.
* Shoots a ray from $(0.25,0.25,1)$ straight down; intersection should happen at $z=0$ with $t=1$.
* Confirms `scene.intersect(...)` returns `true` and that `hit_record.t` is correct.

### Refinements & missing checks

1. **Verify the normal and object pointer**
   You only check that `t` is correct and that the point lies on the ray. In a typical `HitRecord` you also store:

   * The surface normal at the hit point
   * A pointer/reference to the object that was hit
   * Possibly texture coordinates or material information
     After `ASSERT_TRUE(scene.intersect(...))`, add:

   ```cpp
   EXPECT_VEC3_EQ(hit_record.normal, /* the triangle’s normal: Vec3(0,0,1) */);
   EXPECT_EQ(hit_record.object, &unit_right_triangle);
   ```

   (Adjust based on how your `HitRecord` and `Scene` store object references.)

2. **Check `t_min` and `t_max` behavior**
   You constructed `Ray(...)` with explicit `t_min=0.0` and `t_max=100.0`, which is fine. But you should also test that if `t_min` is set to something > 1.0 (say, 1.5), the same ray *does not* register a hit:

   ```cpp
   Ray lateRay(Vec3(0.25, 0.25, 1.0), Vec3(0,0,-1), 1.5, 100.0);
   HitRecord rec2;
   EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(lateRay, rec2));
   ```

   This guards that your `Scene` respects a non‐zero `t_min`.

3. **Verify that the ray origin exactly on the surface still hits**
   You have a separate test for origin‐on‐plane, but to be thorough, you could combine “origin exactly at $(0.25,0.25,0)$” with the `Scene` call. That would catch a bug if `Scene`’s fringe‐case logic differs from `moller_trumbore`.

---

## 2. Intersect\_EmptyScene\_ReturnsFalse

```cpp
TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_EmptyScene_ReturnsFalse)
{
  Scene scene;
  Ray ray(Vec3(0, 0, 0), Vec3(1, 0, 0), 0.0, 100.0);
  HitRecord rec;

  EXPECT_EQ(scene.size(), 0);
  EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray, rec));
}
```

### What it tests well

* A scene with no objects should always return `false`—no hit.

### Refinements

1. **Check that `rec` is untouched**
   Optionally you can verify that `rec` remains in a known “invalid” state (for example, maybe `rec.t` is still `+∞` or some sentinel). If your `HitRecord` has a default sentinel, add:

   ```cpp
   EXPECT_EQ(rec.t, std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity());
   ```

   Or whatever default you expect.

---

## 3. Intersect\_MultipleObjects\_ReturnsClosest

```cpp
TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_MultipleObjects_ReturnsClosest)
{
  Scene scene;
  scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);      // Hit at t ≈ 1
  scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle_zm1);  // Hit at t ≈ 2

  Vec3 rayOrig(0.2, 0.3, 1.0);
  Vec3 rayDir(0.0, 0.0, -1.0);

  Ray ray(rayOrig, rayDir, t_min, t_max);

  HitRecord hit_record;
  ASSERT_TRUE(scene.intersect(ray, hit_record));
  EXPECT_NEAR(hit_record.t, 1.0, 1e-6);
}
```

### What it tests well

* When two triangles are collinear under a single ray, only the closer one should register. Good use of “closest hit” logic.

### Refinements

1. **Also verify that the returned object is the first triangle**
   Right now you only check `t ≈ 1.0`. You should also validate:

   ```cpp
   EXPECT_EQ(hit_record.object, &unit_right_triangle);
   ```

   Otherwise, your code might accidentally return the farther object’s `t` by bug.

2. **Test if `unit_right_triangle_zm1` were added first**
   What happens if you insert the farther triangle before the closer one?

   ```cpp
   Scene scene2;
   scene2.add_object(unit_right_triangle_zm1); 
   scene2.add_object(unit_right_triangle);
   HitRecord rec2;
   ASSERT_TRUE(scene2.intersect(ray, rec2));
   EXPECT_NEAR(rec2.t, 1.0, 1e-6);
   EXPECT_EQ(rec2.object, &unit_right_triangle);
   ```

   This ensures your “closest hit” logic doesn’t depend on insertion order.

## 4. Intersect\_RayMissesAll\_ReturnsFalse

```cpp
TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_RayMissesAll_ReturnsFalse)
{
  Scene scene;
  scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);

  Ray ray(Vec3(2, 2, 0), Vec3(3, 4, 5), t_min, t_max);
  HitRecord hit_record;
  EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray, hit_record));
}
```

### What it tests well

* Verifies a ray that clearly does not intersect the unit triangle (it starts at $(2,2,0)$, shoots up in a different direction) returns `false`.

### Refinements

1. **Use a ray direction that actually passes “near but not through”**
   The example $(2,2,0)$ with $(3,4,5)$ never even goes near the plane $z=0$ (it goes “upward”). You might also test a ray that *skims* the $z=0$ plane but misses in $x/y$:

   ```cpp
   Ray ray2(Vec3(2, 2, 1), Vec3(0, 0, -1), 0.0, 100.0);
   // At t=1, point = (2,2,0), which is outside the triangle’s unit square.
   EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray2, hit_record));
   ```

2. **Check that `hit_record.t` was not modified** (or reset to +∞):

   ```cpp
   EXPECT_EQ(hit_record.t, std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity());
   ```

---

## 5. Intersect\_Degenerate\_Object\_ReturnsFalse

```cpp
TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_Degenerate_Object_ReturnsFalse)
{
  Vec3 v0(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  Vec3 v1(1e-8, 0.0, 0.0);
  Vec3 v2(2e-8, 0.0, 0.0);

  Scene scene;
  scene.add_object(Triangle(v0, v1, v2));  // Skinny triangle - almost 0 area

  Ray ray(Vec3(1e-9, 1e-9, 1.0), Vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 100.0);

  HitRecord hit_record;
  EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray, hit_record));
}
```

### What it tests well

* When you add a nearly‐collinear (very “skinny”) triangle, the intersection routine should treat it as “degenerate” or “no‐hit.” Good.

### Refinements

1. **Make the degeneracy threshold explicit**
   If your `Scene::intersect` / `moller_trumbore` rejects when $\lvert\det\rvert < \varepsilon$, verify that epsilon is small enough to accept “almost‐zero” triangles. Maybe also test a triangle of size $1e-6$ that should still count:

   ```cpp
   Vec3 u0(0, 0, 0);
   Vec3 u1(1e-6, 0, 0);
   Vec3 u2(0, 1e-6, 0);
   Scene scene2;
   scene2.add_object(Triangle(u0, u1, u2));
   Ray ray2(Vec3(1e-7, 1e-7, 1.0), Vec3(0,0,-1), 0.0, 100.0);
   HitRecord rec2;
   ASSERT_TRUE(scene2.intersect(ray2, rec2));
   EXPECT_NEAR(rec2.t, 1.0, 1e-6);
   ```

---

## Missing Test Cases to Consider

1. **Back‐face culling at the Scene level**
   If `Scene` or your ray‐triangle intersection is set up to cull back‐faces, add a test with a ray that hits the triangle from “below” (same normal direction) and ensure it returns `false`:

   ```cpp
   TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_BackFaceCulled_NoHit)
   {
     Scene scene;
     scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);
     // Ray from (0.25,0.25,-1) pointing down (0,0,-1) → hits the underside of the triangle
     Ray ray(Vec3(0.25, 0.25, -1.0), Vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 100.0);
     HitRecord rec;
     EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray, rec));
   }
   ```

2. **Origin exactly on an edge or vertex**
   You covered this at the triangle‐level, but Scene‐level might differ if you combine multiple objects. For instance:

   ```cpp
   TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_RayOriginOnEdgeInPlane_MultipleObjects)
   {
     Scene scene;
     scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);
     scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle_below);
     // Ray origin on edge AB of the top triangle (0.5, 0, 0), direction (0,0,-1).
     Ray ray(Vec3(0.5, 0.0, 0.0), Vec3(0,0,-1), 0.0, 100.0);
     HitRecord rec;
     EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray, rec)); 
     // (Or if your implementation treats t=0 as a hit, adjust to EXPECT_TRUE + t=0.)
   }
   ```

3. **Multiple overlapping objects in the same plane**
   If two triangles overlap exactly in 3D space (co‐planar and overlapping), make sure Scene picks one in a deterministic way (e.g. the first inserted). For example:

   ```cpp
   TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_OverlappingTriangles_SamePlane)
   {
     Scene scene;
     // Two identical triangles exactly co-located:
     scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);
     scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);
     Ray ray(Vec3(0.2, 0.2, 1.0), Vec3(0,0,-1), 0.0, 100.0);

     HitRecord rec;
     ASSERT_TRUE(scene.intersect(ray, rec));
     EXPECT_EQ(rec.object, &unit_right_triangle); 
     // The second object is identical, so the first‐inserted should win.
   }
   ```

4. **Non‐axis‐aligned triangle intersection via Scene**
   You wrote a test for the *tilted* triangle in your ray‐triangle tests. Now do a Scene‐level test:

   ```cpp
   TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_TiltedTriangle_Hit)
   {
     Scene scene;
     scene.add_object(tilted_triangle);
     // As before, pick barycentric (u=0.2,v=0.3) → P=(0.8,0.7,0.4)
     Vec3 P2(0.8, 0.7, 0.4);
     Vec3 N = (Vec3(1,2,0.5) - Vec3(0,0,0))
            .cross(Vec3(2,1,1) - Vec3(0,0,0));  // = (1.5, 0.0, -3.0)
     Vec3 rayOrig = P2 + N;                // (2.3, 0.7, -2.6)
     Vec3 rayDir  = N * -1.0;              // (-1.5, 0.0, 3.0)
     Ray ray(rayOrig, rayDir, 0.0, 100.0);

     HitRecord rec;
     ASSERT_TRUE(scene.intersect(ray, rec));
     EXPECT_NEAR(rec.t, 1.0, 1e-6);
     EXPECT_EQ(rec.object, &tilted_triangle);
     EXPECT_NEAR(rec.u, 0.2, 1e-6);
     EXPECT_NEAR(rec.v, 0.3, 1e-6);
   }
   ```

5. **Ray with finite `t_max` that intersects beyond that range**

   ```cpp
   TEST_F(SceneTestFixture, Intersect_ExceedsTMax_NoHit)
   {
     Scene scene;
     scene.add_object(unit_right_triangle);
     // Ray from (0.2,0.3,1) straight down. Intersection is at t=1, so if t_max < 1 it must miss.
     Ray ray(Vec3(0.2, 0.3, 1.0), Vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 0.5);
     HitRecord rec;
     EXPECT_FALSE(scene.intersect(ray, rec));
   }
   ```

6. **Verify “closest among multiple objects” with different orientation**
   If you had a second triangle above the first, ensure the “closest” is chosen appropriately.

---

## Naming and Style Tips

* Instead of naming your second triangle `unit_right_triangle_zm1`, pick something descriptive like:

  ```cpp
  const Triangle unit_right_triangle_below{ … };
  ```

  or

  ```cpp
  const Triangle unit_right_triangle_offset_down{ … };
  ```

  That makes clear it has the same shape but sits one unit below.

* When checking `hit_record`, use the same macros you defined (e.g. `EXPECT_VEC3_EQ`) for consistency.

* Always check the returned `HitRecord.object` pointer (or index) so you know you hit the correct instance.

* Explicitly test both `t < t_min` and `t > t_max` by crafting rays that violate those bounds.

---

## Summary of Improvements

1. **Confirm normal & object pointer** in every “hit” test.
2. **Test t\_min/t\_max clamping** (both too‐small and too‐large).
3. **Back‐face culling** at Scene level.
4. **Overlapping‐coplanar objects**: ensure deterministic object selection.
5. **Multiple insertion orders**: “closest hit” should not depend on insertion order.
6. **Tilted‐triangle via Scene**: duplicate one of your standalone triangle tests at the Scene level.
7. **Ray origin exactly on a boundary (edge/vertex)**: verify handling at Scene level in multi‐object scenarios.

With those additions—especially verifying normals/objects and the `t_min`/`t_max` behavior—your Scene‐level tests will be much more robust and truly “production‐worthy.”
